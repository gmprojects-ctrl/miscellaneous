# Miscellaneous
Code that I've written for fun and are not part of any wider projects.

I've organised everything based on language rather than anything else.

## List of Things

## ASM
 
This part is currently dead. ~~I was going to attempt to learn it over summer but gave up~~



## C Language
 
- Barnsley Fern programme which generates a Barnsley Fern

- Julia Sets programme which generates a Julia Set

- MandelBrot programme which generates the MandelBrot Set

- MathExtra which is a collection of algorithms implemented in C such as Erato's Sieve

- Some initial dabblings to make a text editor ( not working on currently).


## C++ Language
 
I was testing out the Raylib library and created the following programmes.

- Conway's Game of Life

- A Lorenz Attractor

- A Paint Clone ~~(Which might become a dedicated project if I have the time )~~

## Python

- A simple Black Jack game

- An attempt to make a Thesaurus ~~(Which I might work on)~~

## Rust

- Basic Fibonacci Programme

## Shell 

- A collection of shell scripts that create a Wikipedia out of markdown files. (Now developed in its own repo)

## Haskell

- Similar Reason to ASM
