# Miscellaneous
Code that I've written for fun and are not part of any wider projects.

Most code are abandonware, not functional. Some are functional but
are _too small_ to be fully fledged projects.

Evethough mostly abandoned, the code written in this repo could
be used in later projects.

I've organised everything based on language rather than anything else.
**However note that this list is not exhaustive, and this repo is mainly
code scrapbook that I add things that I can't work on anymore**
## List of Things

## ASM
 
This part is currently dead. ~~I was going to attempt to learn it over summer but gave up~~



## C Language
 
- Barnsley Fern programme which generates a Barnsley Fern

- Julia Sets programme which generates a Julia Set

- MandelBrot programme which generates the MandelBrot Set

- MathExtra which is a collection of algorithms implemented in C such as Erato's Sieve

- Some initial dabblings to make a text editor ( not working on currently).


## C++ Language
 
I was testing out the Raylib library and created the following programmes.

- Conway's Game of Life

- A Lorenz Attractor

- A Paint Clone ~~(Which might become a dedicated project if I have the time )~~

## Python

- A simple Black Jack game

- An attempt to make a Thesaurus ~~(Which I might work on)~~

- Text Generation through Stochastic Matrix
## Rust

- Basic Fibonacci Programme

## Shell 

- A collection of shell scripts that create a Wikipedia out of markdown files. (Now developed in its own repo)

## Haskell

- Similar Reason to ASM
